# Code for Replication Study

## Introduction

We have replicated the experiments in _Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Fundus Photographs_ that was published in JAMA 2016; 316(22) [1]. In February 2018 the paper had 236 citations in Google Scholar. However, to our knowledge this presented work is the first attempt to reproduce their results. We had to replicate the method since the source code is not available. Since replication studies are uncommon in the field of deep learning, we believe our results give a general insight into the reproducibility of published deep learning methods. This repository presents the source code for this replication study.
